an app for reading manga and webtoons

The idea is that i want something like yomichan on iphone.

The first version is supposed to be a simple cbz reader.
The next version should have the OCR to mark stuff and then look it up.
In the version afterwards you will maybe be able to look stuff up like yomichan but that's not possible on iphone i think and kinda useless in web since yomichan exists.
So I'm kinda not sure if this even makes sense but we will see.
